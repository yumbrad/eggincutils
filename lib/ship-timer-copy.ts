  longDescription:
    "This tool generates a complete return schedule for all ships and mission lengths from a single launch timestamp, applying FTL duration reduction where it is valid and preserving your chosen reference settings. It supports grouped and flat views, sorting by ship or earliest return, and time-of-day highlighting so you can quickly spot returns that land during awake windows versus sleep windows. The goal is to make launch timing decisions practical: you can compare short, standard, and extended routes side by side and choose launches that align with when you can actually check in.",
