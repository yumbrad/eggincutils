  longDescription:
    "This tool reads your profile inventory and craft counts, then evaluates every craftable artifact through full recipe recursion so parent crafts and required sub-crafts are costed together instead of in isolation. It accounts for the in-game craft cost discount progression from your existing craft history, estimates total Golden Egg spend and total XP gain for each planned craft count, and compares direct craft efficiency versus deeper auto-craftable paths from available ingredients. The result is a ranked, explainable craft plan showing how many times to craft each item, expected XP, expected cost, and XP-per-GE efficiency so you can decide where to spend next.",
