  longDescription:
    "This planner reads your current profile, turns your mission history into current ship levels and launch options, expands the requested item into every required ingredient, and then evaluates mission targeting and crafting choices together in one optimization model. It uses expected drop rates by ship, level, and target family; your inventory and craft history; the in-game craft cost discount curve; three concurrent mission slots; optional inclusion of slotted stones; and optional prep launches to unlock or level ships before farming. The output shows the plan with expected mission launches, crafts, and source breakdown so you can see what is expected to come from inventory, crafting, and mission drops, then refresh and replan as new mission returns arrive.",
